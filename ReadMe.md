# Chargeports App

You will need to install yarn locally

### Install dependencies

`Yarn install`

### Start the project

`expo start`

### Changing basePath

For now, you will need to update your base path in /src/service/ApiService.ts
change the variable `const basePath` to your local ip. This needs to be changed to
env variables.
